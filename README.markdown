This repository is a mixed bag of Bro scripts that are too specific to be
included in the official [Bro scripts
repository](http://git.bro-ids.org/bro-scripts.git). The scripts are
of expirimental nature and might have a few edges, so you are welcome to ping
me for feedback and clarifications.

Please see the file `COPYING` for the licence details.

Documentation
=============

bodies.bro
----------
This script reassembles HTTP bodies and raises an event with the complete
contents. Concretely, it reassembles the current request and/or response body
via the `http_entity_{begin,data,end}` events and raises the new event
`http_body` which has the following signature:

    http_body: event(c: connection, is_orig: bool, data: string, size: count);

As with all Bro HTTP scripts, `is_orig` differentiates requests from replies.
The field `data` contains the body and `size` holds the body length in bytes.

Because the keeping track of all HTTP bodies would likely exceed the
amount of available memory, we need to focus of a subset of HTTP message
bodies. The script offers the following variables in the namespace `HTTP` to do
so:

    ## Flag that indicates whether to hook request bodies.
    const hook_request_bodies = F &redef;

    ## Flag that indicates whether to hook reply bodies.
    const hook_reply_bodies = T &redef;

    ## The pattern applies 
    const hook_host_pattern = /.*/ &redef;

    ## Do not buffer more than this amount of bytes per HTTP message.
    const max_body_size = 50000000;

Requires Bro 2.x

two conversing buddies. [My blog][fb-chat-post] contains a bit more details
about this script.

This script analyzes ARP traffic for gratuitous replies, spoofed fields in
replies, and spoofed fields in requests, as well as conflicts with existing
entries in the ARP table and DHCP assignments.
